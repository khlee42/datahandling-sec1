This mock exam is designed to help you become familiar with the test environment and format we'll use for the actual exams. While the focus is mainly on getting you comfortable with the testing setting, the questions are still relevant to the course material. The exam consists of two parts:


- Part 1 includes a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions aimed at testing your understanding of Python syntax.
- Part 2 will require you to write a program based on detailed instructions. Be sure to follow these instructions closely, including the specific names for functions and variables, as your code will need to pass certain test cases. Your code should run without errors and meet all the specified requirements.

Please note that during the actual exams, you'll be able to move on to Part 2 only after submitting Part 1. Additionally, the number of questions may vary.
