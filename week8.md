title: Week 8 - Data Manipulation in Pandas
subject: Lecture
subtitle: Pandas, DataFrame, Series, Indexing, Filtering, Grouping, Aggregation, Joining
---

This session will introduce the `pandas` library, which is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis in Python. We'll learn how to create a `DataFrame` object, which is a tabular data structure that is similar to a table in SQL, and how to perform basic data manipulation tasks such as filtering, sorting, grouping,aggregation, and joining. We'll also learn how to connect to a database from Python and execute SQL queries.

:::{important} Goals
1. Connect to a database from Python
2. Execute SELECT queries from Python
3. Understand how to use the `fetchone()` and `fetchall()` methods
4. Learn how to use the `pandas` library to handle tabular data
